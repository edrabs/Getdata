Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project - Elliot Drabs - 12/11/2014

This raw dataset includes the readings from 30 subjects performing 6 different activities, Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking Downstairs, and Walking Upstairs. There are a multitude of different readings from a cellular phone, as listed below. I do not know what each of them means, but hopefully as a downstream analyst being tasked with looking at this data, you do.

The output tidy data set includes the means and stardard deviations from each of these readings. The included file rownames.txt corresponds with the dataset to help piece this all together. 

The colunm names are arranged by Subject, and by Activity. For instance, the column heading X23.WALKING corresponds with subject #23, doing the activity of Walking. This structure applies across all the columns.
